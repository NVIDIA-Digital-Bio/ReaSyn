Model Application(s)                               |  Synthesis Pathway Prediction in drug, chemical, and materials design.
Describe the life critical impact (if present)   |  Experimental results: Additional in silico and experimental tests are recommended before using the predicted synthesis paths in downstream applications.
Use Case Restrictions                              |  Abide by [NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license/)
Model and Dataset Restrictions            |  The Principle of least privilege (PoLP) is applied limiting access for dataset generation and model development. Restrictions enforce dataset access during training, and dataset license constraints adhered to.
